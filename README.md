# Gojo

A compilation of git katas - exercises that make you more confident in
using more advanced git features.

## Usage

* Clone this repository: `git@github.com:salemove/gojo.git && cd gojo`.
* See the list of available katas with `git branch`. Every branch is
  a kata.
* Pick a kata and start it with e.g. `git checkout kata-1-fixup`.
* Run `./start` to start the kata and print instructions.
* Do it.
* Execute `./test` to check your results.
* Run e.g. `git reset --hard origin/kata-1-fixup` to start over.

If you've broken everything beyond repair, just delete the folder and start
over from the top, by cloning this repository again.
